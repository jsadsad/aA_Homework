# What is React?

In addition to Facebook, React is used by Uber, Airbnb, Netflix, Yahoo, Pinterest, Feedly, Coursera, Product Hunt, and OpenTable.

_REACT_ is a front-end JavaScript library for creating UI components. It is not an MVC, just V.g

# vs jQuery

jQuery is the most popular Javascript library in use, allowing developers to manipulate the DOM, handle events, and make Ajax request, among other things. It's possible to build a single page app using just jQuery. However, that would put the onus of managing efficient re-renders on the developer.

With React, on the other hand, all we have to do is worry about updating state and the React diffing algorithm will determine what needs to be re-rendered.

# vs Vue
Vue is a relatively new, open source, and community-driven library. React and Vue share several similarities, including a virtual DOM, dynamic view components, companion libraries that handle routing (react-router), and global state (react-redux).

Vue provides big improvements in speed relative to React, in part attributed to a lighter-weight virtual DOM and a more selective re-rendering of components. However, Vue is developed by a much smaller community, and lacks many of the libraries React has. Unlike React and Angular, it doesn't have the large, organizational support of Facebook or Google.
