# React Router

React Router is a frontend routing library for React. It allows you to control which components you display using the browser location.

`HashRouter` is the primary component of the router that wraps our route hierarchy. It works similarly to Provider - creating a React context that passes information (in this case, routing information) down to all its descendent components.
